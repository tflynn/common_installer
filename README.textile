h1. Bootstrap Installer

p. A lightweight installation system aimed at installing any of the configured software stacks.

p. Since there is no mature cross-platform dependency / package manager, the approach used is to build specific versions of software for particular platforms from sources. 

p. Currently supported platforms are:

* OS X
* Redhat 5 / Centos 5 - any system that uses YUM

p. The system is written as a Bash script - assuming every system has bash - and then in Lua. (http://www.lua.org/) - a small, portable scripting language.

h2. Source packages

p. The source package repository is currently managed on a public Dropbox for installation use.

p. The bootstrap installer files themselves are available from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12189743/InstallationFiles/bootstrap_installer/bootstrap_installer

p. The repository can easily be copied to any desired location.

p. [To be supplied - can't rsync from Dropbox]

h2. Running the installer

<pre>
sudo ./bootstrap_installer
</pre>

h2. Requirements

p. The whole reason for this bootstrap installer is - a bare minimum of requirements

* Bash
* Some version of GCC - at least 4.1
* Some version of curl or wget

p. In practice, the first thing that the system will look for is the GCC compiler. If not present try and install is the GCC compiler using the native installation tools. On OSX the Developer tools must be installed.

p. The installation system uses 'wget'. If 'wget' is not present, the installation system will try to use 'curl' to obtain 'wget'. If 'curl' is not present, then the system will attempt to install 'curl' using the native installation tools. 'wget' will then be installed from a source package from the installation repository. This is the only potential use of 'curl' by the installation system.

p. Everything else comes from the installation repository.

h2. Default Settings

p. All the default settings are declared at the start of the file 'bootstrap_installer'. If they need to be overridden, place the values in a file 'bootstrap_installer.defaults' in the same directory as 'bootstrap_installer'. They will be loaded as the very first part of the bootstrap process if present.

h2. Other platforms

p. This system should be easy enough to apply to any *nix version. Extend the GCC installation method 'installGCC()' and maybe 'getLinuxPlatformType()' in the initial script 'bootstrap_installer'. That should be the only system-specific dependency.
